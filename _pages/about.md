Hello there fren!
{: .text-justify}
I'm Kadalyst, aka Kad, Kaddicus, KaddicusAlmighty, and KadTheHunter.

This website is my fourth major foray into any sort of programming; Previous projects include my [Core plugin](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/Core) for PocketMine-MP API 3.0, the [KÃ¦dykos Nebula](https://kadthehunter.github.io/Kydykos-Nebula/) website, and [The Shulker Archives](https://kadthehunter.github.io/ShulkerArchives/index.html) website.

I've also done many smaller projects, such as updating and expanding a [Nickname plugin](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/Nickname) for PocketMine-MP, creating a [variety of tools with MadCommands](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/MadCommands) for XOXO High RolePlay, and updating the [elytra-recast](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/elytra-recast), [AccurateBlockPlacement-Reborn](https://github.com/hschwar/AccurateBlockPlacement-Reborn) and [meteor-litematica-printer](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/meteor-litematica-printer) Minecraft mods to newer versions.

I'm a big fan of Free Open Source Software (FOSS), and refuse to succumb to any form of subscription model on the internet.

My posts here cover a large variety of topics, from Minecraft NBT and Building, to cool software/websites I've found, AI generated content, Greentexts, and random brain bugs.

Hope you enjoy :)
