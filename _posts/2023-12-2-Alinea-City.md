# Background
A little more than a month ago an old friend of mine, Becca, invited me to her old Minecraft Bedrock server we used to play on "XOXO High RolePlay". To both our surprise a lot of builds still existed there, despite the server having been abandoned for more than two years, and the map having suffered several rollbacks/wipes before the server shutdown.

Among the many cool and amazing builds we found, there were a few that stood out; Either due to nostalgia and memories of building them, or to the sheer impressiveness of the build itself.

One such build was Alinea City, originally built by Beccaaaxoxo, paige989, VentralArt38119, and sileXtsoul.

We instantly knew Alinea City had to be saved, so that we could share it with others, and return to it in the future.

There was just one teensy little problem...

# Issues
The servers host ([leet.cc](https://leet.cc/)), doesn't allow downloading of Worlds, Schematics, or anything else.

No problemo, just use something like [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) or [WorldTools](https://modrinth.com/mod/worldtools) to save a copy client-side, right? *Wrong*. Bedrock doesn't have anything like that, unfortunately.

I eventually tried using the [MadCommands](https://mad-hon.com/MadCommands/) plugin, with a joint [python/madcommands service by Tit79A](https://github.com/Tit79A/LEETSchematics) to export schematics, but it was ultimately futile; While it did export a usable `.schematic` file, the build contained had a horribly mangled palette, that couldn't be fixed with anything (and yes, I tried everything, from loading it in different MC versions, to using tools such as [Amulet Editor](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Map-Editor) to convert it between Bedrock and Java) 

This is the part where any sane person would admit defeat; All normal and abnormal methods had been exhausted, and the only remaining method to port it is manually placing the blocks in Java one by one, and that would take ages to do.

I am not a sane person.


# Porting
We used the [TotalFreedom](https://totalfreedom.tf/) Minecraft Server to port the build, and it can currently be viewed at `/warp Alinea`.

Progress was slow, mainly due to the nature of the project, but also because we wanted to be extremely careful; Every length was measured multiple times both on Bedrock and Java, every block was double-checked to make sure it was correct, every piece replicated perfectly.

Over the course of a month starting in the beginning of November 2023 we built Alinea, eagerly awaiting its completion.

Finally on December 2nd 2023, the port was complete: Alinea City, in all of its un-finished glory.


# Files

I exported Alinea City in 3 formats, all included below. 
You will need [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit/) and [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) for the `.schem` and `.litematic` files respectively

- [Alinea-City.litematic](/assets/builds/alinea/Alinea-City.litematic)

You can also see the build on [PlanetMineCraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/alinea-6132636/); Be sure to give it a Diamond!
