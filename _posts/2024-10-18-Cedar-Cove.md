# Background
Nearly a year after Becca and I started work on porting [Alinea City]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-12-2-Alinea-City %}), I present to you its sequel: Cedar Cove.

We originally began porting this by hand like with Alinea, (and if we had to do it that way, we'd still be working on it now!) but then we got very very lucky: the host used for the server, [leet.cc](https://leet.cc/), announced their closure, and distributed copies of worlds and player data to their respective servers owners.

This gave us the opportunity to update and convert not just the entire map, but every single world.

In a future post, I will be sharing all the worlds, including details on their conversion, how to convert them yourself, and future projects involving them.

For now, on to Cedar Cove!

# Cedar Cove
Cedar Cove is a small beach town, known for its charming neighboorhoods, esteemed High School and College, beautiful lighthouse views, and laid back attitude. 

Relax on the beach, shop in the Cedar Cove mall or the chic beach-side boutiques, dine at Vinnie's Italian or Sal's Exotic Bar & Grill, and cap off the day watching the sunset from the lighthouse.

If it's love at first sight, why don't you stay? Cedar Cove has a variety of beautiful homes just waiting for you to move in!

## Origins
Cedar Cove was created by 
- Beccaaa xoxo (~Becca)
- paige989 (~Paige)
- VentralArt38119 (~Ven)
- casehhh (~Drewww)
- IIEmptyIIv (~Empty)
- Isanghaeyo (~Misho)
- LilPad2025 (~Finley)
- KinzMcd (~Kinz)
- IV Spxce VI (~Ace)
- XxPoai (~Poh)
- SniperRiffle48 (~Brandon)
- RedChain1987 (~Red)

I also had a small hand in making it, though I went uncredited due to drama between myself and about half of the above list.

It was built between May 15th 2020 and July 31st 2020, and served as the primary RolePlay city for the server at the time. There are still references to the server at large across the map, most notably the signs next to bus-stops that provide useful information about the server.

## Conversion to Java
Unlike [Alinea-City]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-12-2-Alinea-City %}), I had (and have) the full world files to work with, and was able to convert them to Java with a minimum of missing or broken blocks. The largest issue was Signs, which I manually checked and repaired across the city.

After this, it was simply a matter of extracting the city itself from the world, and pasting it into another world (which proved easier said than done, due to the extreme size of the schematic).

All in all a fairly fast conversion, with not much to remark on here.

# Files
I exported Cedar Cove in 3 formats, all included below, though I recommend using the `.zip` file, as the Schematic is absurdly large.

You will need [WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit/) and [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica) for the `.schem` and `.litematic` files respectively

- [CedarCove.zip](/assets/builds/cedarcove/CedarCove.zip)
- [CedarCove.schem](/assets/builds/cedarcove/CedarCove.schem)
- [CedarCove.litematic](/assets/builds/cedarcove/CedarCove.litematic)

You can also see the build on [PlanetMineCraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/cedar-cove/); Be sure to give it a Diamond!
